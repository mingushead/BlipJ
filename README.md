First project in Java, built in partial fulfillment of my Master's program, at UCC. Series of experimental programs exploring the possibilities of data transmission via audio signal between household devices. For more details on the project, including performance statistics, and future work considerations, please visit eamon.design/final_draft.pdf

Potential employers! If you are viewing this project in an attempt to review the quality of my code, my own contributions are listed below, all other files were written by the TarsosDSP developmental team.
